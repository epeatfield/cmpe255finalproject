# cmpe255finalproject

FInal Project for CMPE 255 at San Jose State completed by Emma Peatfield, Trung Huynh, and Saurabh Ghotane.

The objective of our project was to take current and past weather data that was available online and use it
to predict what type of storm could occur from certain weather variables. We chose to use weather data from 
the National Climatic Data Center, which was available to download from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration website. This weather data has thousands of stations that have been collecting local climate 
data throughout the United States since early 1940â€™s. It contains features, such as dry and wet bulb temperatures, 
wind speed, wind direction, humidity, visibility, precipitation, etc. We wanted to use this data to create a model 
that, when given values for these features, it could predict if there will be a storm or not, and if so, what type of storm.
